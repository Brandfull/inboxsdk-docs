title: Conversations
---
This namespace allows you to interact with Gmail conversations (typically called threads). The fundamental views you interact with are ThreadView and MessageView and there is a 1 to many relationship between them. The functions in Conversations.* allow you to obtain these views which you can then further manipulate.

It's important to note that ThreadViews and MessageViews can be navigated to in various ways by the user depending on their email client and their settings (i.e. preview pane on in Gmail). This is abstracted completely away from you so you can just focus on manipulating the views once they are given to you.

Finally, when a ThreadView loads, you're not guranteed that every MessageView in it is also loaded. When you call ThreadView.getMessageViews it will return all MessageViews, but its important to remember that the MessageViews might not be loaded. MessageViews can be in several states. Consult the MessageView documentation to learn about what functionality is available in each state.

### Namespace methods

## MessageView
Object that represents a visible message in the UI. There are properties to access data about the message itself as well as change the state of the UI. MessageViews have a view state as well as a loaded state. These 2 properties are orthogonal to each other.

A messages' view state can be one of MessageViewViewStates.EXPANDED, MessageViewViewStates.COLLAPSED or MessageViewViewStates.HIDDEN. Gmail visually display messages in a thread in different ways depending on what they are trying to show a user. These values are described in the enum MessageViewViewStates.
The load state of a message determines whether all of the data pertaining to a message has been loaded in the UI. In some case, not all the information (such as recipients or the body) may be loaded, typically when the the view state is COLLAPSED or HIDDEN. You should not depend on any relationship between the view state and load state. Instead, use the provided MessageView.getViewState() and MessageView.isLoaded() methods.

### Methods
#### addAttachmentCardView(cardOptions)
Adds an AttachmentCardView to the message. Each message has an area where attachments of that message are shown as a set of preview cards. These may be for file attachments or even inline YouTube links. This method allows you to add your own.

_Returns_ a `boolean`

#### isLoaded()
Returns whether this message has been loaded yet. If the message has not been loaded, some of the data related methods on this object may return empty results. The message may be loaded once the user clicks on the message stub.

_Returns_ a `boolean`

#### getLinksInBody()
Returns an array of MessageViewLinkDescriptors representing all the links in the message and their associated metadata. This is useful when you want to parse links in a message and take some action on them, this takes care of detecting whether the link is in the qouted area or not and parsing out the url/anchor text of the link. i.e. if you wanted to linkify all dates you found in a message for scheduling purposes

## AttachmentCardOptions
This type is accepted by the MessageView.addAttachmentCardView() method to insert an AttachmentCardView for a message. An attachment card offers a way to display a rich preview of any 'attachment' to a message. Note that 'attachments' is referenced in the generic sense and need not be a downloadable file specifically. One example would be to show you YouTube attachment cards for any YouTube links present in an email.


| Property | Type | Description | Required? | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **title** | `string` | The title of the attachment card. Typically a filename is set here. | Yes |  |
| **description** | `string` | A description of the attachment card displayed subtly. | Yes |  |
| **previewUrl** | `string` | The url of an "open" or "preview" action for this attachment. The attachment cards primary action (clicking on the card) takes the user in a new window to the URL specified here. This is also the URL used if the user right clicks and copies the link address. | Yes |  |
| **previewThumbnailUrl** | `string` | A URL to an image representing the thumbnail preview of the attachment card | Yes |  |
| **failoverPreviewIconUrl** | `string` | URL to an icon to fallback on in case the previewThumbnailUrl fails to load. | Yes |  |
| **previewOnClick** | `function(event)` | A callback to call when the user clicks on the preview area. Note that if the previewUrl is also set, the preview will open in a new window in addition to this callback being called. The PreviewEvent has one property - attachmentCardView. It also has a preventDefault() function. Calling this function prevents the preview from opening in a new window. | Yes |  |
| **fileIconImageUrl** | `string` | The url of the icon of the attachment. | Yes |  |
| **buttons** | `Array<(DownloadButtonDescriptor|CustomButtonDescriptor)>` | An array of buttons to support functionality in addition to the preview functionality | Yes |  |
| **foldColor** | `string` | The color of the attachment card fold and an accompying accent color. | No | `#BEBEBE` |
| **mimeType** | `string` | The mime type of the attachment if it has one. This is used to render image mime types slightly differently to be consistent with Gmail. Specifically, the previewThumbnailUrl images are rendered full bleed to show as much of the image as possible. As such the hover UI looks slightly different. | No | `null` |







---
## AttachmentCardNoPreviewOptions
This type is accepted by the MessageView.addAttachmentCardView() method to insert an AttachmentCardView for a message. An attachment card offers a way to display a rich preview of any 'attachment' to a message. Note that 'attachments' is referenced in the generic sense and need not be a downloadable file specifically. One example would be to show you YouTube attachment cards for any YouTube links present in an email.

These options differ from AttachmentCardOptions in that there is no previewThumbnailUrl, instead you use a iconThumbnailUrl to show a generic icon. These are rendered and positioned slightly differently than preview images.

| Property | Type | Description | Required? | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **title** | `string` | The title of the attachment card. Typically a filename is set here. | Yes |  |
| **description** | `string` | A description of the attachment card displayed subtly. | Yes |  |

| **iconThumbnailUrl** | `string` | A URL to an icon to show in the thumbnail area of the attachment card | Yes |  |
| **previewOnClick** | `function(event)` | A callback to call when the user clicks on the preview area. Note that if the previewUrl is also set, the preview will open in a new window in addition to this callback being called. The PreviewEvent has one property - attachmentCardView. It also has a preventDefault() function. Calling this function prevents the preview from opening in a new window. | Yes |  |
| **fileIconImageUrl** | `string` | The url of the icon of the attachment. | Yes |  |
| **buttons** | `Array<(DownloadButtonDescriptor|CustomButtonDescriptor)>` | An array of buttons to support functionality in addition to the preview functionality. | Yes |  |
| **foldColor** | `string` | The color of the attachment card fold and an accompying accent color. | No | `#BEBEBE` |
